# Duolingo Profile

ðŸŽ¯ _Heard you skipped your Spanish lesson today..._ Yeah, Duo knows. Duo _always_ knows.

_Duolingo Profile_ brings the ever-watchful gaze of the green owl straight into your Home Assistant dashboard.
No more excuses, track exactly who's keeping their streak alive... and whoâ€™s about to get a not-so-gentle reminder from Team Duo.

Whether youâ€™re proudly guarding a 365-day streak or you're "starting again tomorrow" for the 17th time:
This integration lays it all bare: XP, streaks, crowns, lessons completed â€“ neatly tracked, and ready to motivate or mildly shame.

Perfect for:
 * Families or friends competing for Duolingo dominance
 * Data nerds with a side of language guilt
 * Or anyone who wants to know if their friends are actually learning... or just pretending

**Duo sees all. Now you can too.**
